# highscore-micro-one
A FastAPI ASGI microservice to query a high score list.

Backend is a NoSQL database deployed on Deta Space. (Cloud deployment shown via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bcorfman/highscore-micro-one/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-deploy.yml).)

I'm using this project to practice simple microservice design with Python.
